	In 1977 NASA sent it's first time capsule of sorts into deep space.
	Aboard Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/goldenrec.html">discs made of gold</a> that hold images and sounds from Earth. While Voyager 2 is now in the outermost layer of the heliosphere, Voyager 1 has left our solar system and is now in interstellar space.

	If you missed the opportunity back in '77 or if you weren't around at the time like myself, now is your chance to leave your mark in space all without taking a day off work.

	NASA will be sending a silicon microchip containing the names of those wanting to take part. In March of 2016, spacecraft InSight will launch from California carrying the names. Insight will make it's 6 month long journey before it's Mars landing. The final destination for it's personalized cargo, fittingly called "Elysium Planitia, (Plain of Ideal Happiness)".
